# Development

This guide is for contributors maintaining MacroSignage from source. User and operator setup starts in [Installation](installation.md) and [Deployment](deployment.md).

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaezFJ/MacroSignage.git
cd MacroSignage
uv sync --all-groups
cp .env.example .env
uv run macrosignage dev
```

The development server reads `.env`, creates the SQLite database automatically, and serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` unless you pass different CLI options.

Useful commands:

```bash
uv run macrosignage dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
uv run macrosignage dev --no-debug
uv run macrosignage-prod --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --threads 4
uv run macrosignage-upgrade --dry-run --no-backup
```

## Run Checks

These commands match `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```bash
uv lock --check
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv run python -m compileall src/macrosignage tests
uv build
uv run twine check dist/*
```

Run focused tests while iterating:

```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_api.py
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_display_player.py
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_operational_readiness.py
```

## Packaging

Build the main Python package:

```bash
uv build
uv run twine check dist/*
```

The main package exposes:

```text
macrosignage = macrosignage.cli:main
macrosignage-prod = macrosignage.cli:prod_main
macrosignage-upgrade = macrosignage.cli:upgrade_main
```

The standalone display client is separate:

```bash
cd client
uv sync --extra build
uv run macrosignage-client --help
uv run pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name MacroSignageClient macrosignage_client/app.py
```

See [Standalone Client](client.md) for operator-facing client setup.

```

## Feature Blueprint Pattern

Feature packages follow a small, explicit pattern:

```text
features/<feature>/
├── __init__.py
├── routes.py
├── models.py
├── services.py
├── forms.py
└── templates/
```

Use the existing structure when adding or changing a feature:

- `routes.py`: Flask routes, request/response control flow, redirects, and templates.
- `models.py`: SQLAlchemy models and model-level convenience properties.
- `services.py`: database queries, token generation, file storage, and business rules.
- `forms.py`: form parsing, validation constants, and UI option lists.
- `templates/`: Jinja templates grouped under the feature's admin/player/auth path.

Register new blueprints from `src/macrosignage/features/__init__.py`. Keep admin routes behind the existing admin endpoint prefixes so login and role checks apply.

## Static Assets

Application CSS and JavaScript live in `src/macrosignage/static/`.

Vendored frontend libraries are checked in under `src/macrosignage/static/vendor/` so installed packages do not depend on a CDN:

- Bootstrap v5.3.8 in `vendor/bootstrap/`
- Animate.css v4.1.1 in `vendor/animate/`

When replacing a vendored library, keep its license file and update package data patterns in `pyproject.toml` only if new file types are required.

## Tests

The automated suite covers Flask route contracts, admin CRUD workflows, API authorization, player-token access, schedule selection logic, package metadata, production hardening, deployment docs, client configuration helpers, and CLI entry point parsing.

Browser media playback for real image, video, neon sign, vCard QR, YouTube, HTML iframe, and slider timing should still be checked manually before a production release because it depends on browser codecs, network access, and display hardware behavior.

## Release Automation

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`: publishes MacroSignage to PyPI when a `v*` tag is pushed.
- `.github/workflows/client-build.yml`: builds standalone client executables on demand and for `v*` tags.
- `.github/workflows/client-release.yml`: uploads standalone client executables to the matching GitHub Release.

## Version Tag Release Test

The release process was exercised with the `v0.2.1` tag on May 6, 2026:

- `Publish PyPI` succeeded from the `v0.2.1` tag.
- `Build Client` succeeded from the `v0.2.1` tag.
- `Release Client` exposed a workflow path bug in the tagged workflow, then succeeded through manual dispatch targeting `v0.2.1` after the workflow path was fixed.
- The GitHub Release for `v0.2.1` contains Windows, macOS, and Linux client executable assets.

Regression coverage for the release workflow triggers and client asset paths lives in `tests/test_release_workflows.py`.

Before tagging, run the checks above, complete the [Release Documentation Checklist](release-documentation-checklist.md), and review [Architecture](architecture.md), [Deployment](deployment.md), and the active roadmaps.
